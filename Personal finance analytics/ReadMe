I created this project to monitor my personal spends from the monthly bank statements that I receive. 

Tools used:
  - Python (for extracting tables from pdf files and writing them to MySQL database)
  - MySQL (for storing tables in a single table in MySQL database) 
  - Power BI (for visualizing data from table created above in MySQL) 

This project basically does the below tasks:

1). It takes the password protected pdf bank statements from a folder and decrypts using 'qpdf' software
2). Then files are modified using 'tabula' module which provides a list of dataframes for each table found in pdf
3). Once all the dataframes and cleaned and appended into 1 dataframe then it is written into sql using 'sqlalchemy' module
4). Duplicate columns are deleted based on 'key' column by running sql query from within python using 'pymysql' module
5). Once data is written into MySQL database, then it is used by Power BI as a source and visualization of the spend analysis takes place.
